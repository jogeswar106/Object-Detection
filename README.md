# Object-Detection
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT (Object Detection)
Object detection is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video. Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects, which allow us to locate where said objects are in (or how they move through) a given scene.
Object detection is commonly confused with image recognition, so before we proceed, itâ€™s important that we clarify the distinctions between them.

Modes and types of object detection.
  Broadly speaking, object detection can be broken down into machine learning-based approaches and deep learning-based approaches.
  In more traditional ML-based approaches, computer vision techniques are used to look at various features of an image, such as the colour histogram or       edges, to identify groups of pixels that may belong to an object. These features are then fed into a regression model that predicts the location of the     object along with its label.
